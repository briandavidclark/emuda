# Emuda

Emuda is my personal library of helper functions. Many of them were adapted from Ramda.js

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:Emuda, git: "https://github.com/briandavidclark/emuda.git", "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/Emuda>.
